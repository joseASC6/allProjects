# To Do List
1. ![Wireframe](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week2.day2.layouts/blob/master/totalCenter/wireframe.png?raw=true)
2. Set the background to the "shoes.jpg" image in the "assets" folder
   - To add an overlay, see this [css-trick for tinting background image](https://css-tricks.com/tinted-images-multiple-backgrounds/) - The wireframe features a 45% opacity white overlay
3. Add a div with the "aperture.svg" image and an h3 with some text inside of it
4. Use the flexbox model to center the contents of div horizontally and vertically
   - *Note: the height might be tricky. You can set height relative to a percentage of the view window: `height: 100vh`*
